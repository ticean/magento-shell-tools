magento-shell-cache
===================

Mage_Shell script that interfaces with the Magento cache.


Description
-------------------

Magento base code supplies a set of shell scripts for Magento CLI. Unfortunately, they did not include a shell interface
 for the cache.  magento-shell-cache fills the gaps.


Usage
-------------------

You can use this shell script like the other Magento shells. Help is provided.

    php -F cache.php


Requirements
-------------------

Magento (with shell). The script was developed on EE 1.9, but should work with any Magento version that has the /shell
directory.


Installation
--------------------

Copy cache.php to your Magento /shell directory.
